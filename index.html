        <h2>What is P4P Ranking ?</h2>
        <p>Pound for pound is a ranking used in combat sports, such as boxing, wrestling, or mixed martial arts. It is based
            on who is the most skilled/best boxer if you take out weight differences</p>

    <h2>10. Anthony Joshua</h2>
    <p>a two-time unified heavyweight champion, having held the WBA, IBF, WBO, and IBO titles since December 2019 and
    previously between 2016 and June 2019. In recent years it was very rare to have heavyweights in the P4P list but it's hard to disregard Joshua's achievements especially after a convincing win over Ruiz.</p>

    <h2>9. Naoya Inoue</h2>
    <p>Naoya Inoue is a Japanese professional boxer. He is a three-weight world champion and currently a unified bantamweight
    world champion, having held the WBA, IBF, and Ring magazine titles since 2019. In my opinon he is lucky to get into this list given the level of opponent he has faced but with Muhammad Ali Trophy to his name, he's definetely proved to be an elite fighter</p>

        <h2>8. Manny Pacquiao</h2>
        <p>Manny aka "Pacman" has competed in professional boxing since 1995 and is regarded as one of the all-time greats of the sport for good reason. He is the first boxer to win the lineal championship in five different weight classes, won 12 major world titles in <strong>eight</strong> different weight divisions. Most recently he beat Keith Thurman convicingly to win the WBA (Super) welterweight championship. Pacquiao powers are definetely diminishing from the levels he was once at but he is still one of the best ever.

    <h2>7. Gennady Golovkin</h2>
    <p>
        Golovkin often known by his nickname "GGG" is a <strong>two</strong> time middleweight world champion. He previously held the unified WBA (Super), WBC, IBF and IBO titles between 2014 and 2018 and was ranked as the world's
        best boxer, pound for pound, from September 2017 to September 2018 by The Ring magazine. In GGG last fight beat Sergiy Derevyanchenko by a controversial unanimous decision. This led to pundits questioning if GGG was done performing at the highest level. With a third fight being lined up with canelo alvarez he has the opportunity to put those claims to bed.

    <h2>6. Oleksandr Usyk</h2>
    <p>
Usyk reigned as the undisputed cruiserweight champion from 2018 until he vacated his titles in 2019, being the first
cruiserweight in history to hold <strong>all four major </strong>world championships—the WBA (Super), WBC, IBF and WBO titles. He claimed that status in stunning fashion by becoming the first man to hold the Muhammad Ali Trophy. Since then, he has vacated his belts and cruiserweight division in favour of the heavyweight division. His first clash as a heavyweight was against Chazz Witherspoon where he dispatched of Chazz within 7 rounds but there questions of if he would be able to compete with the divisions top dogs. With a potential matchup with AJ as his manditory seeming more and more distant he will have ample opportunity to prove himself, especially against a dangerous Derek Chisora
